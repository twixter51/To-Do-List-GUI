# To-Do-List-GUI
Uses wxWidgets Library (C++)

This is my first project, the code may not look that nice (FOR NOW) but please bear with me :).

Since I'm using wxWidgets, this UI is cross-platform, current features include:



v.1  


-- Add tasks by typing into a search bar


-- Remove tasks by selecting one or many


-- Checks to ensure there are tasks entered


-- Prioritize Feature (Prioritize tasks that you deem most important) (W.I.P)

# Planned Updates
-- V.1.1 (Finished Prioritize feature)
