# To-Do-List-GUI (WxWidgets) Guide On Set-Up Soon
Uses wxWidgets Library (C++)

This is my first project, the code may not look that nice (FOR NOW) but please bear with me :).

Since I'm using wxWidgets, this UI is cross-platform, current features include:

-- Add tasks by typing into a search bar

-- Remove tasks by selecting one or many

-- Checks to ensure there are tasks entered

--  priority feature (set priority to any task you like! there are currently 2 forms, yellow (normal priority), red (urgency)

-- prioritize features for better readability, color enhancements, tooltips.

-- remove all tasks button

-- remove all priorities button

-- prompt logic is now better

-- Saving system, saves your data to SavesFile1.txt


 # curr version: V.2.0
 


# Planned Updates
-- Release V.1 --Soon just have to set up gitHub codeSpace so if you want you could contribute to this project
