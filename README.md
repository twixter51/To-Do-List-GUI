# To-Do-List-GUI (Guide on how to set up in code-space soon, you will need wxWidgets)
Uses wxWidgets Library (C++)

This is my first project, the code may not look that nice (FOR NOW) but please bear with me :).

Since I'm using wxWidgets, this UI is cross-platform, current features include:

-- Add tasks by typing into a search bar


-- Remove tasks by selecting one or many


-- Checks to ensure there are tasks entered

--  priority feature (set priority to any task you like! there are currently 2 forms, yellow (normal priority), red (urgency)

-- prioritize features for better readability, color enhancements, tooltips.

-- **new** remove all tasks button

-- **new** remove all priorities button

-- **new** prompt logic is now better

-- Next update will include the final implementation of the project with a saving system. Then I'm finished! 

 # curr version: V.1.5
 


# Planned Updates
-- V.2.0 --Clean Up Code, Finish project, add saving

# still under works!!!
