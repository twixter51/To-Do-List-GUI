# To-Do-List-GUI
Uses wxWidgets Library (C++)

This is my first project, the code may not look that nice (FOR NOW) but please bear with me :).

Since I'm using wxWidgets, this UI is cross-platform, current features include:

-- Add tasks by typing into a search bar


-- Remove tasks by selecting one or many


-- Checks to ensure there are tasks entered

-- *new* priority feature (set priority to any task you like! there are currently 2 forms, normal priority (red), #1 priority (blue/with highlight)

-- *new* prioritize features for better readability, color enhancements, tooltips.

-- more to come

 # curr version: V.1.25
 


# Planned Updates
-- V.1.3 (Code clean-up)
